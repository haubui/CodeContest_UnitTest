# CodeContest_UnitTest
This code simulates a scenario where you have a certain number of empty Coca-Cola bottles (numBottles) and can exchange them for a new bottle (numExchange). You want to find the total number of bottles you can drink (allDrinkAble) by considering both the initial bottles and those obtained through exchange.
